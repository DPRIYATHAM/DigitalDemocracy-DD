# SecureVote
*Elections made digital and easier*

## Problem Statement
In the current landscape of democratic processes, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) face challenges related to political interference, lengthy voting procedures, and potential user unfamiliarity with technology. The hackathon challenge is to design a secure and efficient voting system that addresses these issues. Key objectives include mitigating political interference through robust encryption, streamlining the voting process to reduce time, creating a user-friendly interface for mobile and web applications, ensuring transparency in the voting mechanism, and integrating secure methods for voters to cast their votes through digital platforms. Evaluation criteria will focus on the effectiveness of security measures, the efficiency of the system, user experience, and overall transparency in the electoral process. The goal is to foster innovation and develop a voting system that is both secure and accessible, meeting the demands of modern democratic elections.
